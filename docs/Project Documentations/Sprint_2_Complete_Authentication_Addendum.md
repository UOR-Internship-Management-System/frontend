# Sprint 2 Complete Authentication Addendum

**Project:** CV Management and Deterministic Internship Candidate Filtering System
**Document type:** Supplemental Sprint 2 implementation addendum
**Status:** Draft for supervisor/team review
**Generated:** 2026-07-09
**Purpose:** Capture the supervisor-requested Sprint 2 authentication expansion without modifying existing project documents directly.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The original Sprint 2 implementation plan focused on Student onboarding and authentication only. The supervisor has now requested **complete authentication during Sprint 2**, including:

1. Student onboarding and authentication.
2. Student forgot-password reset.
3. Admin Sign-In.
4. Admin forgot-password reset.
5. Admin password creation/reset using predefined Admin accounts provisioned by the development team.

This addendum confirms that the change is feasible if it is treated as a **Sprint 2 scope reallocation** rather than a broad Admin module expansion.

Only **Admin authentication** moves into Sprint 2. Admin dashboard data, academic ledger management, registered student inspection, companies, internship requests, filtering, shortlisting, and exports remain in their later planned sprints.

---

## 2. Scope Decision

### 2.1 Approved Sprint 2 Authentication Scope

Sprint 2 shall now be titled:

> **Complete Authentication: Student Onboarding, Student Login/Reset, Admin Sign-In, and Admin Password Reset**

Sprint 2 includes:

| Area | Included in Sprint 2 |
|---|---|
| Student sign-up | Full Name, Index Number, University Email |
| Student auto-verification | Index Number + University Email against eligible records |
| Student OTP | issue, verify, resend, expiry, retry handling |
| Student initial password creation | after OTP verification |
| Student login/logout | JWT/session handling and `/auth/me` |
| Student forgot password | OTP-based recovery and password reset |
| Admin login | predefined Admin email/password |
| Admin password reset | OTP-based recovery and password reset |
| Admin RBAC | Admin token, `/auth/me`, Admin route protection |
| Shared security | safe errors, rate limits, audit/security event hooks |

### 2.2 Explicitly Not Included in Sprint 2

The Sprint 2 change must **not** introduce any of the following:

| Excluded Item | Reason |
|---|---|
| Admin self-registration | Admin accounts remain predefined/provisioned by the development team |
| Admin approval of Student sign-up | Removed scope |
| Pending/rejected Student registration lifecycle | Removed scope |
| Temporary password workflow | Removed scope |
| Admin-issued temporary password | Removed scope |
| Admin dashboard metrics implementation | Still belongs to Sprint 6 unless separately approved |
| Academic ledger upload/validation/commit | Still Sprint 6 |
| Registered Student list/deep-dive | Still Sprint 6/7 |
| Company login or company portal | Removed scope |
| Admin Skill Master / skill CRUD/import | Removed scope |
| CV review/approval workflow | Removed scope |
| AI scoring/ranking/match percentage | Removed scope |

---

## 3. Feasibility Audit

### 3.1 Feasibility Conclusion

The requested change is feasible because:

1. Admin login is already an approved Version 1 capability.
2. Admin accounts are already expected to be predefined, not self-registered.
3. The backend authentication module already covers Student/Admin login, JWT/RBAC, and role enforcement.
4. The database model already supports role-based user accounts and predefined Admin users.
5. Existing OTP/password-reset patterns can be reused for Admin reset if the API wording and frontend routes are extended carefully.
6. No removed-scope feature is required to support Admin Sign-In or Admin password reset.

### 3.2 Main Documentation Gap

The only gap is that current password reset wording is Student-centered. This addendum resolves that by defining a safe extension:

> Password reset is supported for predefined `STUDENT` and `ADMIN` account types through OTP-based account recovery.

This does **not** authorize Admin self-registration, temporary passwords, Admin approval, or Admin operational modules.

---

## 4. Sprint Implementation Plan Addendum

### 4.1 Original Sprint 2 Position

Original Sprint 2:

> Student Onboarding and Authentication

Original Sprint 2 deliverable:

> Student sign-up, auto-verification, OTP, password creation, login, logout, and forgot-password reset.

### 4.2 Revised Sprint 2 Position

Revised Sprint 2:

> Complete Authentication

Revised Sprint 2 deliverable:

> A Student can complete onboarding and authentication, and a predefined Admin can sign in and reset a forgotten password using OTP-based account recovery.

### 4.3 Sprint 6 Adjustment

Original Sprint 6 included:

> Admin login/dashboard, ledger upload/staging/validation/commit, registered Student list.

Revised Sprint 6 should become:

> Admin dashboard, academic ledger upload/staging/validation/commit, registered Student list, and Admin operational module integration.

Admin login moves to Sprint 2. Admin dashboard implementation remains Sprint 6, except for a route shell needed to verify successful Admin login redirection.

### 4.4 Revised Sprint 2 Goal

Build the complete authentication foundation for both valid actors:

- Student account lifecycle.
- Predefined Admin sign-in.
- OTP-based password recovery for Student and Admin.
- JWT/RBAC session handling.
- Public/protected route separation.
- Role-aware redirects.
- Removed-scope guardrails.

### 4.5 Revised Sprint 2 Day Plan

| Day | Focus | Output |
|---:|---|---|
| Day 1 | Contract alignment and branch setup | Confirm API changes, route names, schema change for reset account type, DB migration plan |
| Day 2 | Student auth backend/frontend | Student sign-up, verification modal, OTP, initial password, login |
| Day 3 | Admin Sign-In | `/admin/login`, backend admin credential validation, Admin JWT, Admin route guard |
| Day 4 | Unified password reset | Student/Admin forgot-password, OTP verify/resend, reset password, integration tests |
| Day 5 | QA, demo, retrospective | End-to-end Student auth demo, Admin auth demo, negative-scope scan, supervisor review |

---

## 5. API / OpenAPI Addendum

### 5.1 API Design Decision

Use a **shared account recovery flow** for Student and Admin accounts.

Reason:

- Student and Admin accounts both authenticate through the backend authentication system.
- Admin accounts are predefined, not self-registered.
- A shared reset flow avoids duplicated OTP logic.
- Role-specific frontend routes can still call the same backend endpoint with `accountType`.

### 5.2 Endpoint Summary

| Endpoint | Method | Access | Sprint 2 Use |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `/auth/student/login` | POST | Public | Student login |
| `/auth/admin/login` | POST | Public | Admin Sign-In |
| `/auth/me` | GET | Student/Admin | Current authenticated user context |
| `/auth/logout` | POST | Student/Admin | Logout/session invalidation |
| `/student-verifications` | POST | Public | Start Student sign-up verification |
| `/student-verifications/{verificationId}/otp/verify` | POST | Public | Verify Student onboarding OTP |
| `/student-verifications/{verificationId}/otp/resend` | POST | Public | Resend Student onboarding OTP |
| `/student-verifications/{verificationId}/password` | POST | Public | Create initial Student password |
| `/password-resets` | POST | Public | Start Student/Admin password reset |
| `/password-resets/{resetId}/otp/verify` | POST | Public | Verify reset OTP |
| `/password-resets/{resetId}/otp/resend` | POST | Public | Resend reset OTP |
| `/password-resets/{resetId}/password` | POST | Public | Set new password after reset OTP |

### 5.3 Required OpenAPI Wording Change

Current Student-only wording should be replaced with account-type wording.

#### Replace

```yaml
summary: Start forgot-password flow for a Student university email.
```

#### With

```yaml
summary: Start OTP-based password reset for a supported Student or Admin account.
```

#### Replace

```yaml
description: Access: Public. Audit: Security. Uses OTP, not temporary password.
```

#### With

```yaml
description: >
  Access: Public. Audit: Security.
  Supports OTP-based password reset for STUDENT and ADMIN accounts.
  Admin accounts must already be predefined/provisioned.
  This endpoint must not create accounts, approve registrations, or issue temporary passwords.
```

### 5.4 PasswordResetStartRequest Schema Addendum

Recommended request schema:

```yaml
PasswordResetStartRequest:
  type: object
  required:
    - accountType
    - email
  properties:
    accountType:
      type: string
      enum:
        - STUDENT
        - ADMIN
      description: Account type requesting password reset.
    email:
      type: string
      format: email
      description: University email for Student or predefined Admin email for Admin.
```

### 5.5 Password Reset Response Rules

The reset start response must be safe against account enumeration.

Recommended response model:

```yaml
PasswordResetResponse:
  type: object
  required:
    - message
  properties:
    resetId:
      type: string
      format: uuid
      nullable: true
      description: Present only when a reset context is created.
    message:
      type: string
      description: Safe user-facing message.
    expiresInSeconds:
      type: integer
      nullable: true
```

Implementation rule:

- For eligible accounts, create reset context and send OTP.
- For ineligible accounts, return a safe response or safe error according to existing API error standards.
- UI text must not reveal whether an Admin or Student account exists.
- Never return raw OTP.

### 5.6 Admin Login Endpoint

`POST /auth/admin/login` remains the Admin Sign-In endpoint.

Request:

```yaml
AdminLoginRequest:
  type: object
  required:
    - email
    - password
  properties:
    email:
      type: string
      format: email
    password:
      type: string
      format: password
```

Success response:

```yaml
AuthTokenResponse:
  type: object
  required:
    - accessToken
    - tokenType
    - expiresInSeconds
    - user
  properties:
    accessToken:
      type: string
    tokenType:
      type: string
      example: Bearer
    expiresInSeconds:
      type: integer
    user:
      $ref: '#/components/schemas/CurrentUserResponse'
```

Admin login rules:

- Only predefined Admin accounts can authenticate.
- Backend must verify `ADMIN` role.
- Disabled Admin accounts must not authenticate.
- Invalid credentials must return a safe generic error.
- No Admin self-registration endpoint may be added.

## 6. Workflow Document Addendum

### 6.1 New Workflow Inventory Item

Add the following Admin authentication workflow:

| Workflow ID | Workflow Name | Actor | Route Entry |
|---|---|---|---|
| `WF-ADM-001A` | Admin Forgot Password / Password Reset | Department Admin | `/admin/forgot-password` |

### 6.2 WF-ADM-001A - Admin Forgot Password / Password Reset

| Section | Specification |
|---|---|
| Workflow ID | `WF-ADM-001A` |
| Workflow Name | Admin Forgot Password / Password Reset |

### 6.3 WF-ADM-001A Step Table

| Step | Actor Action | UI Response | System Action | Data State Change |
|---:|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Admin clicks Forgot Password on `/admin/login` | Routes to Admin Forgot Password page | None | No data change |
| 2 | Admin enters predefined Admin email | Shows Send OTP action | Validates email format and checks account eligibility safely | Reads account without exposing existence |
| 3 | Admin submits reset request | Shows safe send/pending status | Creates reset context if eligible, generates OTP, sends OTP through email adapter | Stores reset context, hashed OTP, expiry, attempt count |
| 4 | Admin enters OTP | Shows OTP verify action and resend option | Validates OTP hash, expiry, status, and retry count | Marks reset context as verified |
| 5 | Admin enters New Password and Confirm Password | Shows Create Password action | Validates password policy and confirmation match | No password write until validation passes |
| 6 | Admin submits new password | Shows pending state | Hashes password and updates Admin account credential | Stores new password hash, closes reset context |
| 7 | Admin receives success | Routes back to `/admin/login` | Invalidates reset context and optional active sessions | Admin can authenticate with new password |

### 6.4 Alternate Paths

| Path | Description |
|---|---|

## 8. Frontend Specification Addendum

### 8.1 Route Additions

Recommended route additions:

| Route | Access | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/admin/login` | Public | Admin Sign-In |
| `/admin/forgot-password` | Public | Start Admin password reset |
| `/admin/verify-reset-otp` | Public with reset context | Verify Admin reset OTP |
| `/admin/create-password` | Public with verified reset context | Set new Admin password |
| `/admin/dashboard` | Admin-protected shell | Redirect target after successful Admin login |

### 8.2 Route Guard Rules

| Route Type | Rule |
|---|---|
| Public auth routes | Available without JWT |
| Student protected routes | Require authenticated user with `STUDENT` role |
| Admin protected routes | Require authenticated user with `ADMIN` role |
| Wrong role | Redirect to `/unauthorized` |
| Missing reset context | Redirect to corresponding forgot-password page |
| Verified reset context missing | Block password creation and redirect safely |

### 8.3 Admin Auth Feature Structure

Recommended feature folder:

```text
src/features/admin-auth/
  api/
    adminAuthApi.ts
  components/
    AdminLoginForm.tsx
    AdminForgotPasswordForm.tsx
    AdminResetOtpForm.tsx
    AdminCreatePasswordForm.tsx
  hooks/
    useAdminLogin.ts
    useStartAdminPasswordReset.ts
    useVerifyAdminResetOtp.ts
    useResendAdminResetOtp.ts
    useCompleteAdminPasswordReset.ts
  pages/
    AdminLoginPage.tsx
    AdminForgotPasswordPage.tsx
    AdminVerifyResetOtpPage.tsx
    AdminCreatePasswordPage.tsx
  schemas/
    adminAuthSchemas.ts
  types/
    adminAuthTypes.ts
  tests/
    admin-auth.test.tsx
```

Shared reusable components may live under `src/shared/ui` only if they do not contain business-specific behavior.

### 8.4 Admin Login Page UI

Admin Login page should follow the existing Admin login visual direction:

- Split layout.
- Left-side welcome panel with administrative greeting.
- Right-side login form card.
- Email field.
- Password field.
- Primary Log In button.
- Forgot Password link.
- Safe error display.
- Loading state during submission.

Required fields:

| Field | Validation |
|---|---|
| Admin Email Address | Required, email format |
| Security Password | Required |

Successful login behavior:

1. Call `POST /auth/admin/login`.
2. Store token according to team security decision.
3. Call or hydrate `/auth/me`.
4. Confirm role is `ADMIN`.
5. Redirect to `/admin/dashboard`.

Failure behavior:

- Invalid credentials show generic message.
- Non-Admin role is blocked.
- Disabled account shows safe support message.
- Network/API failure shows retry-safe message.

### 8.5 Admin Forgot Password Page UI

Route:

```text
/admin/forgot-password
```

Content:

- Page title: `Forgot Password?`
- Helper text: `Provide your administrator email address to request a One-Time Password.`
- Admin email input.
- Send OTP button.
- Back to Admin Login link.

Submission behavior:

```ts
startPasswordReset({
  accountType: 'ADMIN',
  email
})
```

### 8.6 Admin Reset OTP Page UI

Route:

```text
/admin/verify-reset-otp
```

Content:

- Six-digit OTP input.
- Verify button.
- Resend OTP button.
- Expired OTP message.
- Incorrect OTP message.
- Cooldown state after resend.

### 8.7 Admin Create Password Page UI

Route:

```text
/admin/create-password
```

Content:

- Page title: `Create your new password`
- New Password field.
- Confirm New Password field.
- Create Password button.
- Password match validation.
- Password policy helper text where required.

Success behavior:

- Show success state.
- Redirect to `/admin/login`.

Do not auto-login Admin after reset unless explicitly approved. Returning to login is safer and consistent with controlled authentication.

## 13. Open Decisions

| Decision | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| Separate Admin reset endpoints vs shared reset endpoint | Use shared `/password-resets` with `accountType` |
| Admin reset success behavior | Redirect to `/admin/login`, do not auto-login |
| Admin password provisioning method | Dev/test seed; production bootstrap via secret-controlled process |
| OTP delivery in dev | Use local email adapter/MailHog or controlled dev-only display; never persist raw OTP |
| Token storage | Prefer memory or secure cookie depending backend decision; avoid unnecessary long-lived localStorage |
| Admin dashboard in Sprint 2 | Shell only for redirect verification; real metrics stay Sprint 6 |

---

## 14. Final Recommendation

Accept the supervisor-requested change as a **controlled Sprint 2 authentication expansion**.

Implementation is feasible if the team follows these boundaries:

1. Move Admin Sign-In into Sprint 2.
2. Add Admin password reset through OTP.
3. Keep Admin accounts predefined/provisioned by the development team.
4. Use shared password reset infrastructure with explicit `accountType`.
5. Do not add Admin self-registration, temporary passwords, or Student approval.
6. Keep Admin operational modules in Sprint 6 and later.

This addendum should be used as a companion implementation reference without rewriting or directly editing the existing baseline documents.
